# Consent & Safety (Universal)

- Use **opt‑in openers** that offer an easy decline (e.g., “totally fine if not”).
- Keep **personal space**; mirror local norms; no blocking exits or walkways.
- Avoid protected attributes (race, religion, health, politics) in openers and suggestions.
- Respect **time**; offer a short window (e.g., 2–3 minutes).
- If declined, **thank and exit gracefully**.

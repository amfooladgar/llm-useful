# Professional Events

- Prefer **short, opt‑in, topic‑anchored** intros.
- Anchor to **goals** (e.g., “find collaborators”), **interests** (e.g., “Firebase, SwiftUI”).
- Avoid salary/compensation unless the other party brings it up.
- Good pattern: **Intro → Tiny ask → Easy out → Offer reciprocity**.

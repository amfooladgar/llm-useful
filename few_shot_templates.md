# Bridgit Social Prompt Pack — Few‑Shot Prompting Instructions (v1.0)

**Purpose:** This Markdown file contains production‑ready prompting instructions and templates for Bridgit Social across four workloads: **Matching**, **Classification**, **Survey Parsing**, and **Support QA (RAG)**. It also includes rollout, eval, and guardrail guidance.

---

## 0) Quick Glossary

- **Demo (demonstration):** An input→output example included in the prompt to teach the model the desired pattern/format.
- **Evidence (grounding):** Passages/policies/facts (often retrieved) that the model must use/cite to answer correctly. Evidence is *not* an input→output pair.
- **In‑context learning:** The model adapts behavior based on prompt content without updating parameters.
- **MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance):** Retrieval method balancing relevance to the query with diversity across selected items.
- **Stop sequence:** A token/string that, when generated, stops output to avoid run‑on text.
- **JSON/grammar mode:** API features that constrain output to a schema.
- **Self‑consistency:** Generate multiple candidate solutions and aggregate (e.g., majority vote) to improve reasoning accuracy.
- **Semantic leakage:** Unwanted copying of specific names/details from demos into outputs.
- **Canary release:** Send a small slice of traffic to a new prompt/version before full rollout.
- **Auto‑rollback:** Automatic revert to a prior prompt/version when guardrails are breached.

## 1) Global Principles

1. **Instruction‑first:** Instructions > Evidence > Demos in authority order; state this explicitly in system text.
2. **Consistent schema:** Keep demo outputs structurally identical; prefer strict JSON.
3. **Delimiters:** Separate sections with clear headers (e.g., `### DEMOS`, `### EVIDENCE`, `### QUERY`).
4. **Token economy:** Use 3–5 demos; keep them short and representative.
5. **Ordering effects:** Put the most canonical or safety‑critical demo first or last.
6. **Safety & privacy:** Never infer protected attributes; prefer refusal/deferral when uncertain or unsafe.
7. **Uncertainty handling:** Output explicit `"insufficient_data"` or route to support rather than guessing.
8. **Bilingual option (optional):** A `lang` parameter (`en|fa`) can mirror user‑facing strings in formal Persian.
9. **Stop sequences:** Use a clear stop token (e.g., `###`) after the expected output when needed.

## 2) Templates

### 2.1 Matching (user↔user suggestions)

**Goal:** Given two profiles + session context, return a **score**, **factors**, **risks**, and **two safe openers** (initiator/recipient). No protected‑class inference; consent‑first tone.

```
SYSTEM
You are Bridgit Social’s matching assistant. Return ONLY valid JSON per the schema.
Authority: Instructions > Evidence > Demos. If conflict, follow this order.
Priorities: (1) Consent & safety (2) Relevance to context (3) Brevity.

RULES
- Do NOT infer or use protected attributes (race, religion, sexual orientation, health, etc.).
- Never guess facts; use only provided profile fields or EVIDENCE.
- Keep openers respectful, opt-in, and situational. Avoid pickup lines.
- If data is insufficient, return score=0.0 with "insufficient_data" in risks.

SCHEMA (return exactly these keys)
{
  "score": <float 0.0-1.0>,
  "factors": [ "<short bullet>", ... ],
  "risks": [ "<short bullet>", ... ],
  "suggestions": [
    {"for":"initiator","text":"<one sentence>"},
    {"for":"recipient","text":"<one sentence>"}
  ]
}

### DEMOS
# Demo 1 (typical)
PROFILES:
A: {"goals":["professional_networking"],"interests":["data","startups"],"availability":"today_evening","style":"prefer_to_be_approached"}
B: {"goals":["professional_networking","mentorship"],"interests":["ml","startups"],"availability":"today_evening","style":"likes_to_initiate"}
CONTEXT: {"place":"[VENUE:Cowork Cafe]","city":"[CITY]","event":"[EVENT:Tech Mixer]","time":"18:30"}
OUTPUT:
{
  "score": 0.78,
  "factors": ["Overlapping 'startups'", "Same time window", "Mentorship complement"],
  "risks": ["A prefers to be approached; suggest gentle opener"],
  "suggestions": [
    {"for":"initiator","text":"I’m also into ML + startups—open to chatting about projects over the next 10 minutes?"},
    {"for":"recipient","text":"If you’re up for it, I’d love a quick intro—happy to share what I’m building."}
  ]
}

# Demo 2 (borderline / insufficient)
PROFILES:
A: {"goals":[],"interests":[],"availability":"unknown","style":"unknown"}
B: {"goals":["friendship"],"interests":["outdoors"],"availability":"weekend","style":"unknown"}
CONTEXT: {"place":"[VENUE:Library]","city":"[CITY]","event":"none","time":"14:00"}
OUTPUT:
{
  "score": 0.0,
  "factors": [],
  "risks": ["insufficient_data"],
  "suggestions": [
    {"for":"initiator","text":"If you’re open to meeting new people, would you like to exchange a quick hello? No worries if not."},
    {"for":"recipient","text":"You can ignore or decline—your comfort comes first."}
  ]
}

### EVIDENCE
{{optional_context_snippets_here}}  # e.g., event description, common groups, shared RSVP

### QUERY
PROFILES:
A: {{user_A_json}}
B: {{user_B_json}}
CONTEXT: {{session_context_json}}

Return ONLY the JSON per SCHEMA.
STOP: ###
```

**Notes:** Retrieve 1–2 evidence snippets via embeddings + MMR. Stop sequence `###`.

---

### 2.2 Classification (intent & context labels)

**Goal:** Classify a post/profile blurb into Bridgit‑specific labels (non‑sensitive).

**Label set (customize as needed):**
- `intent:` `professional_networking | mentorship | collaboration | friendship | event_buddy | qna_support | other`
- `availability:` `now | later_today | this_week | weekend | unknown`
- `initiative_style:` `likes_to_initiate | prefer_to_be_approached | either | unknown`
- `tone:` `formal | casual | enthusiastic | reserved`

```
SYSTEM
You classify text into fixed labels. Use only the given text/EVIDENCE. Never infer protected classes.

SCHEMA
{
  "intent":"<one label>",
  "availability":"<one label>",
  "initiative_style":"<one label>",
  "tone":"<one label>",
  "rationale":"<<=20 words>"
}

### DEMOS
Input: "New to the city, looking to meet engineers for side-project collabs this weekend."
Output: {
  "intent":"collaboration",
  "availability":"weekend",
  "initiative_style":"either",
  "tone":"casual",
  "rationale":"mentions collab and weekend availability"
}

Input: "Open to coffee chats about data roles today after 6."
Output: {
  "intent":"professional_networking",
  "availability":"later_today",
  "initiative_style":"likes_to_initiate",
  "tone":"casual",
  "rationale":"explicit coffee chat; today after 6"
}

Input: "If anyone wants to say hi at the meetup, I’m around but a bit shy."
Output: {
  "intent":"friendship",
  "availability":"now",
  "initiative_style":"prefer_to_be_approached",
  "tone":"reserved",
  "rationale":"invites others to approach; present tense"
}

### EVIDENCE
{{optional_metadata_or_event_text}}

### QUERY
Text: {{user_text}}
Return ONLY the JSON per SCHEMA.
```

### 2.3 Survey Parsing (research responses → structured JSON)

**Goal:** Convert free‑text survey answers into a normalized schema. Use empty strings/defaults if missing. Respect uncertainties.

**Schema (example):**
```json
{
  "goals": ["professional_networking|mentorship|collaboration|friendship|event_buddy|other"],
  "openness_to_approach": 1,
  "preferred_venues": ["cafe|cowork|conference|outdoors|other"],
  "time_windows": ["morning|afternoon|evening|weekend|variable"],
  "conversation_starters": ["<short phrase>"],
  "deal_breakers": ["<short phrase>"],
  "contact_method": "dm|in_app|no_preference|other",
  "notes": "<<=50 words>"
}
```

```
SYSTEM
Parse the respondent’s answers into the schema. If absent, use "" or [].
Do NOT invent details. Keep "notes" brief.

MAPPINGS
- Map phrases to Likert 1–5 for openness (“very comfortable”→5, “depends”→3, “not comfortable”→1).
- Robust to typos and synonyms.

### DEMOS
Q&A:
Q: "What brings you here?" A: "Mostly to meet mentors and potential collaborators."
Q: "How comfortable being approached?" A: "I’m fine if it’s brief."
Q: "Preferred places?" A: "Quiet cafes or the coworking space."
Q: "Best times?" A: "Evenings or weekends."
Q: "Good openers?" A: "Ask about current projects."
Q: "Deal-breakers?" A: "Aggressive sales pitches."
Q: "Contact method?" A: "In-app is fine."
Output:
{
  "goals":["mentorship","collaboration"],
  "openness_to_approach":4,
  "preferred_venues":["cafe","cowork"],
  "time_windows":["evening","weekend"],
  "conversation_starters":["current projects"],
  "deal_breakers":["aggressive sales"],
  "contact_method":"in_app",
  "notes":"Mentorship and collab; prefers brief approaches."
}

### QUERY
RawResponses: {{survey_free_text_blob}}

Return ONLY the JSON per schema.
```

### 2.4 Support QA (RAG with citations)

**Goal:** Answer user/host questions **only** from Bridgit’s help/policy docs. Cite `[S1]`, `[S2]`…; if missing evidence, **defer** (no hallucinations).

```
SYSTEM
You are Bridgit Support. Use ONLY EVIDENCE to answer. If insufficient, say so and propose next steps.
Style: concise, friendly, and actionable.

FORMAT
- Short paragraph (<=100 words), then bullet steps if applicable.
- Cite sources like [S1], [S2]. No extra text after the answer.

### DEMOS
Q: "How do I change my visibility?"
EVIDENCE:
[S1] "Settings > Privacy > Visibility lets you switch between 'Visible', 'Friends only', 'Hidden'. Changes take effect immediately."
A: "Go to Settings → Privacy → Visibility and choose 'Visible', 'Friends only', or 'Hidden'. Changes apply immediately. [S1]"

Q: "Can I export my data?"
EVIDENCE:
[S1] "Users can request a data export via Settings > Account > Export."
A: "Yes—Settings → Account → Export lets you request a machine-readable export of your data. [S1]"

Q: "How do you handle harassment?"
EVIDENCE:
[S1] "Report via profile • Immediate block • Trust & Safety review within 24h."
A: "Use 'Report' on the profile or message, and consider 'Block'. Our team reviews within 24 hours. [S1]"

### EVIDENCE
{{top_k_help_center_snippets}}

### QUESTION
{{user_question}}

RULES
- If no evidence answers the question: "I don’t have the info to answer reliably. I can connect you to support or follow up once this is documented." (no citation)
```

---

## 3) Retrieval & Demo Selection

- **Evidence index (RAG):** Help center, policies, safety guidelines, event descriptions. Use embeddings; retrieve top‑k=3–5 via cosine; apply **MMR** (λ≈0.7) to reduce duplication.
- **Demo banks:** Maintain per‑task demo pools (matching/classification/survey/support). At runtime, fetch 2–3 nearest demos + 1 borderline demo (for safety/format). Keep identical formatting across demos.

---

## 4) Guardrails (apply across tasks)

- **Safety:** Refuse/soften when content suggests harassment, coercion, or unsafe meetups.
- **Privacy:** Do not expose or infer protected attributes. No off‑platform contact unless policy allows.
- **Uncertainty:** Prefer `"insufficient_data"` and safe defaults over guessing.
- **Formatting:** Always emit valid JSON when a schema is specified.

**Refusal demo snippet (reusable):**
```
If the request asks for sensitive inference or unsafe behavior, respond with:
{"error":"policy_refusal","message":"I can’t help with that. If you’d like, I can share general safety tips instead."}
```

---

## 5) Evaluation Plan

**Offline (pre‑ship)**
- **Matching:** nDCG@1/3/5 on labeled pairs; AUC for positive pairs; opener quality via human rubric.
- **Classification:** Accuracy/F1 (micro & macro); confusion matrix (watch “other”).
- **Survey Parsing:** Exact‑match on keys; soft F1 on normalized lists; Likert correlation vs. human ratings.
- **Support QA:** Exact‑match on citations; helpfulness (Likert), refusal correctness.

**Online (A/B, canary)**
- Success proxies: reply rate, accepted intros, report rate ↓, CSAT ↑, parse‑error ≈ 0.
- Latency: p95 not worse than +10%.
- Cost: tokens/request not worse than +15% unless justified by quality.

---

## 6) Rollout Strategy

**Playbook**
1. **Version & freeze:** Tag prompts (e.g., `match_v1.0`, `classify_v1.0`, `survey_v1.0`, `support_v1.0`). Keep model/retrieval fixed for attribution.
2. **Offline checks:** Must meet/beat control on primary metrics; pass safety tests.
3. **(Optional) Shadow:** Run side‑by‑side on live requests; don’t show outputs; compare logs (format/policy/latency).
4. **Canary:** 1–5% low‑risk traffic/cohorts; enable **auto‑revert** on guardrail breaches.
5. **Ramp:** 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%, monitoring metrics.
6. **Rollback:** Immediate if policy/latency/cost regress beyond thresholds.
7. **Audit:** Confirm sustained gains across segments; update prompt unit tests & docs.

**Example thresholds**
- Task success ≥ control (or +2–5% absolute).
- Policy violations ≤ control; hard cap ≤ 0.1% absolute.
- p95 latency ≤ control × 1.10.
- Tokens/request ≤ control × 1.15 unless quality justifies.
- Parse/format errors ≤ control (near zero for structured outputs).

---

## 7) Prompt Unit Tests (quick checks)

- **Matching—insufficient:** Profiles missing goals & interests → expect `score=0.0`, `risks:["insufficient_data"]`.
- **Classification—ambiguous:** “Coffee chat today after 6 about data roles” → `intent="professional_networking"`, `availability="later_today"`.
- **Survey—Likert mapping:** “Depends, but generally okay” → openness `3–4` (choose 4 if clearly positive).
- **Support—no evidence:** Question outside docs → defer message (no hallucinated answer).

---

## 8) Optional: Bilingual Output (English / Farsi)

Add a `lang` switch and mirror human‑facing strings:

```
PARAMS: {"lang":"en|fa"}

If lang="fa", produce the same JSON keys but render human-facing strings in formal Persian.
Example (fa):
{"for":"initiator","text":"اگر تمایل دارید، خوشحال می‌شوم چند دقیقه درباره پروژه‌ها صحبت کنیم."}
```

## 10) Maintenance Notes

- Version prompts and keep a changelog (what changed and why).
- Use embeddings for demo/evidence retrieval with MMR.
- Periodically prune demos that cause leakage or brittleness.
- Bake failing production cases into future demo banks with corrected outputs.

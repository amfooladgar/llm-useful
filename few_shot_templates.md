    "# Bridgit Social Prompt Pack — Few‑Shot Prompting Instructions (v1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This Markdown file contains production‑ready prompting instructions and templates for Bridgit Social across four workloads: **Matching**, **Classification**, **Survey Parsing**, and **Support QA (RAG)**. It also includes rollout, eval, and guardrail guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0) Quick Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demo (demonstration):** An input→output example included in the prompt to teach the model the desired pattern/format.\n",
    "- **Evidence (grounding):** Passages/policies/facts (often retrieved) that the model must use/cite to answer correctly. Evidence is *not* an input→output pair.\n",
    "- **In‑context learning:** The model adapts behavior based on prompt content without updating parameters.\n",
    "- **MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance):** Retrieval method balancing relevance to the query with diversity across selected items.\n",
    "- **Stop sequence:** A token/string that, when generated, stops output to avoid run‑on text.\n",
    "- **JSON/grammar mode:** API features that constrain output to a schema.\n",
    "- **Self‑consistency:** Generate multiple candidate solutions and aggregate (e.g., majority vote) to improve reasoning accuracy.\n",
    "- **Semantic leakage:** Unwanted copying of specific names/details from demos into outputs.\n",
    "- **Canary release:** Send a small slice of traffic to a new prompt/version before full rollout.\n",
    "- **Auto‑rollback:** Automatic revert to a prior prompt/version when guardrails are breached.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Global Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instruction‑first:** Instructions > Evidence > Demos in authority order; state this explicitly in system text.\n",
    "2. **Consistent schema:** Keep demo outputs structurally identical; prefer strict JSON.\n",
    "3. **Delimiters:** Separate sections with clear headers (e.g., `### DEMOS`, `### EVIDENCE`, `### QUERY`).\n",
    "4. **Token economy:** Use 3–5 demos; keep them short and representative.\n",
    "5. **Ordering effects:** Put the most canonical or safety‑critical demo first or last.\n",
    "6. **Safety & privacy:** Never infer protected attributes; prefer refusal/deferral when uncertain or unsafe.\n",
    "7. **Uncertainty handling:** Output explicit `\"insufficient_data\"` or route to support rather than guessing.\n",
    "8. **Bilingual option (optional):** A `lang` parameter (`en|fa`) can mirror user‑facing strings in formal Persian.\n",
    "9. **Stop sequences:** Use a clear stop token (e.g., `###`) after the expected output when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Matching (user↔user suggestions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Given two profiles + session context, return a **score**, **factors**, **risks**, and **two safe openers** (initiator/recipient). No protected‑class inference; consent‑first tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SYSTEM\n",

    "Authority: Instructions > Evidence > Demos. If conflict, follow this order.\n",
    "Priorities: (1) Consent & safety (2) Relevance to context (3) Brevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "RULES\n",
    "- Do NOT infer or use protected attributes (race, religion, sexual orientation, health, etc.).\n",
    "- Never guess facts; use only provided profile fields or EVIDENCE.\n",
    "- Keep openers respectful, opt-in, and situational. Avoid pickup lines.\n",

    "1. **Version & freeze:** Tag prompts (e.g., `match_v1.0`, `classify_v1.0`, `survey_v1.0`, `support_v1.0`). Keep model/retrieval fixed for attribution.\n",
    "2. **Offline checks:** Must meet/beat control on primary metrics; pass safety tests.\n",
    "3. **(Optional) Shadow:** Run side‑by‑side on live requests; don’t show outputs; compare logs (format/policy/latency).\n",
    "4. **Canary:** 1–5% low‑risk traffic/cohorts; enable **auto‑revert** on guardrail breaches.\n",
    "5. **Ramp:** 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%, monitoring metrics.\n",
    "6. **Rollback:** Immediate if policy/latency/cost regress beyond thresholds.\n",
